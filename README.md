# Small Language Models - running a ChatGPT equivalent on your own laptop
 
SLMs (Small Language Models) are not as spectacular as increasingly larger LLMs announced every few days.
However, they are a very interesting area of ​​NLP research and a proof that the development of AI
does not have to be an arms race, and a brute force approach of training models
with more and more parameters is not the only way.

During the presentation, I will demonstrate several sample SLMs and then explain how to use them
to run a private equivalent of ChatGPT on your own computer.

## Models

```bash
# CLI
